### What the F1!
I have been a long-standing fan of Formula One racing, which my brother introduced me to. Growing up in a small town in southern Odisha, it was not common among my friends and peers to follow Formula One, to be honest, i liked that.

It was something I enjoyed watching on television, and when Buddha Circuit hosted the first ever Formula One race in India, I had no money (still a student) to afford a seat to watch live. All these years, I had the desire to watch a Formula One race.
